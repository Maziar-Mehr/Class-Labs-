       " 'this sweater is so comfy and classic it balances a quirky hand knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style and as others mentioned there are gaps in the knit that make it see through in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering i like having a longer camisole showing underneath or wearing it over a little dress it s warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat',\n",

       " 'this dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter it is well made and the details are pretty however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach i wear a size l or in dresses at retailer and it just did not flatter my body type at all for a thinner narrow silhouette i suppose it would look better like it does on the model i had to return it',\n",
       " 'i tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress with very interestingly cut seams the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract gorgeous and high quality fit i am and curvy usually a size and the xl fits quite roomy on me that s the size i ordered because i like flowy things so it definitely runs large usually i have better luck with a line dress shap',\n",
       " 'i bought this dress for its green color and flowy design to wear at an irish fest held in the hot summer it s perfect being of irish descent with red hair and fair skin i love all shades of green and this green dress is no exception the color is lovely and eye catching and cool as to the sizing i usually wear a size but to make sure due to the design i ordered an and a there wasn t a great difference between the two dresses but the size top was a bit more fitted and looked bet',\n",
       " 'i just bought this at the store i simply couldn t resist it is very light and comfortable and could easily be dressed up or dressed down sandals and a crossbody bag for exploring the city strappy healed sandals and some flashy jewelry for a garden party or day event slip on booties and a cardigan for the evening can t wait to rock it in terms of sizing i am with dd bust and some hips and booty usually i am a size m in dresses and pants but in true retailer style i ended up',\n",
       " 'i purchased this in the mauve color beautiful color with tan skin for the summer but also perfect for fall the material is very thin but not sheer at all has quite a bit of drape swing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough it fits me like it fits the model shown here i am about lbs and b and am keeping the small',\n",
       " 'i originally ordered this in green and unlike another reviewer i thought the color was perfect for spring it is trendy flattering and fun in green but perhaps not a color i would wear long term so i decided to return it and order it in red and black i also noted the boxy cut and if that is what you want it runs true to size however if like me you want something a little more form fitting consider ordering down a size or two depending on your chest size and just carefully shimmy',\n",
       " 'beautiful dress good quality tts i m feet lbs ordered my small petite no issues however the green is very bright the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista s apron it s going back i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it s a yes',\n",
       " 'i tried this on in the store i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight the material was a little itchy on me but maybe its because the chest was tight the color is lovely pink im sure someone will love it but if you are petite i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty',\n",
       " 'i tried these on at my local retailer and was like no way am i spending almost on a pair of jeans alas i could not stop thinking about them the pictures really don t do them justice they are a more substantial jean have a distressed look without being fragile and yet they are so soft so comfortable you really just don t want to take them off they do have a bit of stretch but hold their shape all day long the length and taper are perfect in that you can wear them with boots san',\n",
       " 'i love this dress i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip it is beautiful and is so comfy it looks good with heels or sandals i definately recommend this dress it would look good on any body type',\n",
       " 'this top is cute and could be worn to work or casually being tall i love how long this shirt is definitely recommend',\n",
       " 'i purchased the gorgeous green color i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it s cooler outside the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it',\n",
       " 'this is a beautiful sweater soft lovely color and easy to wear the current photo is more true to the length i am and pounds and ordered the regular sm and it fits just below my hips',\n",
       " 'i m and weigh lbs i purchased the xxs and it was super wide and big all over it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model also not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long this would work better on a taller person i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace up in the back is cute',\n",
       " 'like other reviewers i was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of jeans however i purchased them at off on retailer day and honestly they look so good i probably would have paid full price these jeans are fresh',\n",
       " 'after reading the reviews i ordered this dress in an xs and sp i m and lbs the xs was too long and too big on the bottom while being too tight in the chest the sp fits perfectly i m wearing this to a wedding and know that i will get lots of use out of it for many different occasions',\n",
       " 'i always look for things to hide parts without making my parts look even more pronounced this top is much cuter in person than online it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didn t notice the length is perfect the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin even though it has stripes perfect spring summer top',\n",
       " 'fit is true to size but keep in mind this dress has a box like fit i am debating whether to have mine taken in a little under the arms the material isn t what i expected but i still love it the dress has a more textured thick fabric instead of the light somewhat silky fabric that the photo portrays i am very happy with the color',\n",
